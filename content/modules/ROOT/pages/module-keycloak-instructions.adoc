== 1. Deploy Globex Coolstore app using Helm

Let's first deploy the fully function (but unsecured) application. We'll use a Helm chart to deploy it to your namespace (`globex-keycloak-{user_name}`). Open the {openshift_cluster_console}/topology/ns/globex-keycloak-{user_name}?view=graph[OpenShift web console^]. If this is the first time you are logging in, select the `globex-keycloak-{user_name}` namespace from the list of namespaces, and the _Developer_ view on the drop-down on the left. You will see the Keycloak operator already installed:

image::keycloak/start.png[]

Click on the Add icon, and enter `cool` into the search box, locate and click on the `Coolstore Microservice` chart, and click `Create`:

image::keycloak/helm.png[]

This helm chart will deploy a fully functional version of our application we wish to secure later on. Leave default value and click `Create`:

image::keycloak/helmcreate.png[]

You should see a number of microservices begin deploying:

image::keycloak/helmcreated.png[]

It will only take a few seconds for all of the services to deploy and turn dark blue. This is our starting point - a fully functional (but not yet API-secured) app.

=== 1.1 Test the app

Once they are all deployed, click on the _frontend_ open link to ensure that the app is running:

image::keycloak/frontend-open.png[]

You should see the application's frontend open in a separate browser tab:

image::keycloak/app-open.png[]

Feel free to click on the various menu items on the left and ensure you see valid customer and product details. Globex recently had an outage, where a hacker was able to infiltrate the inventory data and wreak havoc. So Globex has decided that the product inventory should only be accessible by authorized users, and has asked you to product that particular endpoint with authentication and authorization. Let's use Keycloak to do this.

=== 1.2. Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] to make a few changes to the app. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {devspaces_dashboard}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

image::eap/login_with_openshift.png[login,800]

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_name}
----

* *Password*:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_password}
----

image::eap/che-login.png[login,800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::eap/auth-access.png[auth-access, 800]
====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, delete the workspace first.

image::eap/ds-delete.png[ds, 800]
====

* *Git Repo URL*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
https://github.com/rh-mad-workshop/coolstore-microservice.git
----

image::keycloak/create-ws.png[ds, 800]

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace coolstore-microservice*. It takes about *60* seconds to finish the process.

image::keycloak/init-ws.png[ds, 800]

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

image::keycloak/new-ws.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors`.

image::eap/ds-trust-popup.png[ds, 800]
====

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

== 2. Deploy Keycloak instance

You can install Keycloak in many ways, including just downloading and extracting a zip file, downloading the source and building it, or manually constructing a container and deploying it. Kubernetes Operators make both the installation and management of Keycloak (and many other software packages) much easier, and we have installed the Keycloak operator for you to use.

=== 2.1 Deploy Keycloak Database

Keycloak needs a database to store its data. We'll use Postgres. Back on the {openshift_cluster_console}/topology/ns/globex-keycloak-{user_name}?view=graph[OpenShift web console^], click the Add icon once again, type `postgres ephemeral` into the search box, locate the `Postgres (Ephemeral)` template, click on it, and click *Instantiate Template*:

image::keycloak/postgres-create.png[]

On the next screen, override the following values (leaving the rest as their defaults):

* *Database Service Name*: `keycloak-postgresql`
* *PostgreSQL Database Name*: `keycloak`

Leave the rest as-is, including the username and password, which will be auto-generated for you and you'll refer to them later. Finally, click *Create*:

image::keycloak/postgres-create2.png[]

You should see a postgres database begin spinning up:

image::keycloak/postgres-create3.png[]

=== 2.2 Create self-signed certificate

In the DevSpaces window, Open a Terminal window.

image::eap/new-terminal.png[new-terminal, 500]

In the terminal, make sure you are logged in as your user by running this command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc whoami
----

You should see your username `{user_name}`.

Now, switch to the new project that was created for you:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc project globex-keycloak-{user_name}
----

Let's also make the postgresql database icon show its proper logo:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} label dc keycloak-postgresql "app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql" --overwrite
----

Keycloak needs a certificate pair to use for TLS communication. We will use OpenSSL to generate the key pair, and put the public key in the application so that we can refer to it at runtime. Run this command to create it and then create an OpenShift _Secret_ that holds the resulting key pair:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mkdir -p $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory/src/main/resources/certs/ && \
openssl req -subj '/CN={openshift_subdomain}/O=Test Keycloak/C=US' -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory/src/main/resources/certs/certificate.pem && \
oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} create secret tls keycloak-cert-secret --cert $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory/src/main/resources/certs/certificate.pem --key key.pem
----
This secret will be used in the next step.

=== 2.3 Create Keycloak instance

By creating an instance of a `Keycloak` object, the Keycloak operator will process it and instantiate a new Keycloak server. In the OpenShift web console, click the `Add` icon, type `keycloak` into the search box, click on the "Keycloak" item, and click Create:

image::keycloak/keycloak-create1.png[]

On the next screen, make sure you're in the _YAML view_, and replace the YAML with the following definition:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
apiVersion: k8s.keycloak.org/v2alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: keycloak
spec:
  instances: 1
  http:
    tlsSecret: keycloak-cert-secret
  hostname:
    hostname: keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}
  db:
    vendor: postgres
    host: keycloak-postgresql
    usernameSecret:
      name: keycloak-postgresql
      key: database-user
    passwordSecret:
      name: keycloak-postgresql
      key: database-password
----

This references the certificate+key pair created earlier, as well as our Postgres database credentials, which are stored in a secret. Click *Create*, and you will see your new keycloak server starting up:

image::keycloak/keycloak-create2.png[]

Wait for it to complete (and get a dark blue circle). This should only take a few seconds if everything is working! If it does not after a minute or so, double-check that you entered the right values, and the database secret and certificate secret both exist under the names given.

Let's also visually link Keycloak to its database:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} annotate statefulset keycloak "app.openshift.io/connects-to=keycloak-postgresql" --overwrite
----

=== 2.4 Log into Keycloak

When you use the keycloak operator, it will generate an initial administrator username/password in a Secret. Access the secret by clicking on *Secrets*, and find the `keycloak-initial-admin` secret, and click on it:

image::keycloak/keycloak-secrets1.png[]

Finally, click on *Reveal Values* to see the username (which should be `admin`), and the password:

image::keycloak/keycloak-adminsecret.png[]

`admin` is pretty easy to remember, but you'll probably want to copy the password to your clipboard (using the copy-to-clipboard icon at the far right, or CTRL-C (CMD-C on a Mac)) to use in a moment.

Back on the {openshift_cluster_console}/topology/ns/globex-keycloak-{user_name}?view=graph[OpenShift web console^] topology page, click the small "open" icon at the upper right of the Keycloak deployment:

image::keycloak/keycloak-openicon.png[]

You should land on the Keycloak intro screen:

image::keycloak/admin-intro.png[]

Click *Administration Console* to log in with the following:

* *Username or email*: `admin`
* *Password*: The password you retrieved from the {openshift_cluster_console}/k8s/ns/globex-keycloak-{user_name}/secrets/keycloak-initial-admin[secret^] earlier.

image::keycloak/admin-pw.png[]

Once logged in, you should be at the Admin home screen:

image::keycloak/admin-home.png[]

== 3. Import Realm

A Keycloak _realm_ is a space where you manage objects, including users, applications, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. One Keycloak deployment can define, store, and manage as many realms as there is space for in the database. Keycloak comes with a `master` realm but that's designed to be used for managing Keycloak itself, not for applications.

For authentication purposes, we'll import a new realm called `globex` that has multiple users that we can test our authenticated endpoint code with, as well as a "confidential resource" based on access path, which will enable Keycloak to enforce authorization to this resource without code change.

=== 3.1 Create a KeycloakRealmImport

The Keycloak operator can import realms you supply by creating an instance of a KeycloakRealmImport object in Kubernetes.

We have pre-defined a new realm for this lab, in the `inventory/src/main/resources/globex-realm.yaml` file. The file contains a definition of the realm, which you can see by opening the file in DevSpaces:

image::keycloak/realm-file.png[]

Run the following command to create this object and cause the Keycloak operator to import the realm via a `Job`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory/src/main/resources/globex-realm.yaml
----

You will see a new `Job` created, wait for it to complete (for the circle to turn green) and for the Keycloak pod to automatically restart:

image::keycloak/realm-job.png[]

=== 3.2 Explore Realm

Go back to the https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/[Keycloak administration console] and login as `admin` user (using the password from the {openshift_cluster_console}/k8s/ns/globex-keycloak-{user_name}/secrets/keycloak-initial-admin[Secret^] as before). You should now see a new realm in the Realm dropdown. Select the `globex` realm by clicking on it.

Within the new realm, click on `Users` to see the pre-created users `admin`, `alice`, and `jdoe`:

image::keycloak/new-users.png[]

* `alice` is an ordinary user (will have the `user` role) whose password is `alice`
* `admin` is an Administrator (has the `admin` and `user` role) and their password is `admin`
* `jdoe` is an ordinary user (has the `user` role) but has also been granted access to `confidential` resources in Keycloak, and their password is `jdoe`

We have also created a _Client_ within the realm that will be used by our backend inventory service called `backend-service`. This enables the service itself to authenticate with Keycloak to retrieve realm data.  Click on **Clients** to see this client.

image::keycloak/new-client.png[]

Click on **Realm Roles** to see the roles our users are grouped into, `admin`, `confidential`, and `user` (and a few others). For example, clicking on `admin` > `Users in role` you can see only Alex Admin is in this role. In the `user` role, we have all of our fake users.

We have also defined a `Confidential` resource mapping that allows us to use Keycloak's fine-grained authorization policies to restrict access to certain endpoints without having to change our application code. We'll explore this later!

=== 3.3 Create Secured Resources

There are multiple ways to protect a given API. One way, in Java, is to add `@RolesAllowed` annotations to RESTful resource paths that should only all certain roles to access. In this way, applications can request a list of which roles a given user is in, and only allow access to an API if the user is in the right role. This decision is made on the application side.

Keycloak's _Authorization Services_ provides fine-grained authorization policies that decouples the authorization policy from your code, allowing Keycloak to protect access, so when your policies change, your code doesn't have to.

We will use both ways (`@RolesAllowed` as well as Keycloak Authorization as described above).

== 4. Add secured endpoints using `@RolesAllowed`

[NOTE]
====
In this exercise we are **short-circuiting typical web authentication flows** to illustrate the ease of protecting APIs. In a typical web authentication, users are redirected (via their browser) to a login page, after which a negotiation is performed to retrieve _access tokens_ used on behalf of the user to access protected resources. Here we will be doing this manually with `curl` and directly testing the backend service's authorization and authentication capabilities.
====

Our **inventory service** is built on Quarkus, so we'll need to add a Quarkus extension to our app to enable securing endpoints. In the Terminal window, use this command to add the extension for this, which comes as part of https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/[Microprofile JSON Web Token (JWT)^]. We'll also add the OpenShift extension allowing us easy deploys to OpenShift:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt,openshift"
----

You should see:

[source,console]
----
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-jwt has been installed
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-openshift has been installed
----

This will add the necessary entries in your `pom.xml` to bring in JWT and OpenShift support.


Next, we'll add the necessary configurations to our application to enable it to locate and authenticate with our Keycloak instance. Open `inventory/src/main/resources/application.properties` which contains application configuration values. Add the following values to the end of the file:

[.console-input]
[source,properties,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
# // <1>
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/certs
# // <2>
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex
# // <3>
smallrye.jwt.client.tls.certificate.path=classpath:certs/certificate.pem
# // <4>
smallrye.jwt.client.tls.trust-all=true

----
<1> Sets public key location for JWT authentication. Keycloak exports this for you at the URL.
<2> Issuer URL. This must match the incoming JWT `iss` _claims_ or else authentication fails.
<3> Since we are using self-signed certificates, we manually supply the self-signed public key certificate used to for TLS certificate validation
<4> For simplicity we trust all hosts in this example since we're using self-signed certs. In practice you would not be using self-signed certs, so proper trust chains can be formed.

=== 4.1 Add endpoints

We'll create 2 protected endpoints. Create a new class file `SecuredResource.java` in the `com.redhat.coolstore.inventory.controller` package (in the `inventory/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/inventory/controller` directory) with the following code:

[.console-input]
[source,java,role=copypaste]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.inventory.controller;

import java.security.Principal;
import java.util.Optional;

import jakarta.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.json.JsonString;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Context;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.Claim;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.Claims;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;

@Path("/secured")
@RequestScoped // <1>
public class SecuredResource {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken jwt;  // <2>

    @Inject
    @Claim(standard = Claims.iss)
    Optional<JsonString> issuer; // <3>

    @GET
    @Path("/me")
    @RolesAllowed("user")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String me(@Context SecurityContext ctx) {  // <4>
        Principal caller = ctx.getUserPrincipal();
        String name = caller == null ? "anonymous" : caller.getName();
        boolean hasJWT = jwt != null;
        return String.format("hello %s, isSecure: %s, authScheme: %s, hasJWT: %s\n", name, ctx.isSecure(), ctx.getAuthenticationScheme(), hasJWT);
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/me/admin")
    @RolesAllowed("admin")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String meJwt(@Context SecurityContext ctx) {   // <5>
        Principal caller = ctx.getUserPrincipal();
        String name = caller == null ? "anonymous" : caller.getName();
        boolean hasJWT = jwt != null;

        final StringBuilder helloReply = new StringBuilder(String.format("hello %s, isSecure: %s, authScheme: %s, hasJWT: %s\n", name, ctx.isSecure(), ctx.getAuthenticationScheme(), hasJWT));
        if (hasJWT && (jwt.getClaimNames() != null)) {
            helloReply.append("Injected issuer: [" + issuer.get() + "]\n"); // <5>
            jwt.getClaimNames().forEach(n -> {
                helloReply.append("\nClaim Name: [" + n + "] Claim Value: [" + jwt.getClaim(n) + "]");
            });
        }
        return helloReply.toString();
    }
}
----
<1> Adds a `@RequestScoped` as Quarkus uses a default scoping of `ApplicationScoped` and this will produce undesirable behavior since JWT claims are naturally request scoped.
<2> `JsonWebToken` provides access to the claims associated with the incoming authenticated JWT token.
<3> When using JWT Authentication, claims encoded in tokens can be `@Inject` ed into your class for convenient access.
<4> The `/me` and `/me/admin` endpoints demonstrate how to access the security context for Quarkus apps secured with JWT. Here we are using a `@RolesAllowed` annotation to make sure that only users granted a specific role can access the endpoint.
<5> Use of injected JWT Claim to print the all the claims

=== 4.2 Redeploy to OpenShift

First, add the following properties to your `inventory/src/main/resources/application.properties` file to configure the OpenShift extension:

[.console-input]
[source,properties,role=copypaste,subs="+attributes"]
----
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true <1>
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true <2>
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=openshift <3>
%prod.quarkus.openshift.route.expose=true <4>
%prod.quarkus.openshift.ports."http".host-port=8080 <5>
----
<1> Due to use of self-signed certificates, which Quarkus apps do not trust by default
<2> Instruct the extension to build _and_ deploy.
<3> Instruct the extension to use OpenShift-specific capabilities when needed
<4> Instruct the extension to create a _Route_ so that we can test access the secured inventory service from outside of the cluster.
<5> By default, Quarkus listens on port _80_, but we are using _8080_ by convention for all of our services in this application.

Let's re-build and re-deploy the application to replace the older (unsecured) inventory service. Run this command, which will delete the old deployment and cause the OpenShift plugin to re-deploy our new secured inventory service (and add a visual connector to its postgresql database):

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc project globex-keycloak-{user_name} && \
oc delete deployment inventory && \
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory clean package -DskipTests && \
oc annotate deployment inventory "app.openshift.io/connects-to=postgresql-inventory" --overwrite
----

You should see `BUILD SUCCESS`. The new application will begin deploying. Wait for it to complete (dark blue circle for the `inventory` service on the OpenShift web console).

== 5. Test different user access scenarios

The first thing to do to test any endpoint is obtain an access token from your authentication server in order to access the application resources. We've pre-created a few users in Keycloak for you to use:

* `alice` is an ordinary user (will have the `user` role) whose password is `alice`
* `admin` is an Administrator (has the `admin` and `user` role) and their password is `admin`
* `jdoe` is an ordinary user (has the `user` role) but has also been granted access to `confidential` endpoints in Keycloak, and their password is `jdoe`

Try to access the endpoint as an anonymous unauthenticated user:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i http://$(oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} get route inventory -o=go-template --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/secured/me
----

It should fail with:

[source,none]
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
www-authenticate: Bearer {token}
Content-Length: 0
Set-Cookie: 2a1b392100b8b2cb3705c68f4ecbaf66=1b3560b80b9fad566e105aff1f31f880; path=/; HttpOnly
----

Let's try with an authenticated user next.

=== 5.1 Test Alice

Get a token for user `alice` with this command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
export ALICE_TOKEN=$(\
    curl -ks -X POST https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=alice&password=alice&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 ) && echo $ALICE_TOKEN
----
This issues a `curl` command to Keycloak (using `backend-service` credentials which is a special user that is allowed acess to the Keycloak REST API), and fetches a token for Alice using their credentials.

Try out the JWT-secured API as Alice:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i http://$(oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} get route inventory -o=go-template --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/secured/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
----

You should see:

[source,none]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 63
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Set-Cookie: 2a1b392100b8b2cb3705c68f4ecbaf66=1b3560b80b9fad566e105aff1f31f880; path=/; HttpOnly
Cache-control: private

hello alice, isSecure: false, authScheme: Bearer, hasJWT: true
----

Now try to access the `/me/admin` endpoint as `alice`:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i http://$(oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} get route inventory -o=go-template --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/secured/me/admin \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
----

You'll get:

[source,none]
----
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Length: 9
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Set-Cookie: 2a1b392100b8b2cb3705c68f4ecbaf66=1b3560b80b9fad566e105aff1f31f880; path=/; HttpOnly

Forbidden
----

Alice is not an admin. Let's try with admin!

[WARNING]
====
Access Tokens have a defined lifespan that's typically short (e.g. 5 minutes), so if you wait too long, the token will expire and you'll get denied access. In this case, just re-fetch a new token using the same `curl` command used the first time. Full-fledged applications can take advantage of things like https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/[_Refresh Tokens_^] to do this automatically to ensure a good user experience even for slow users.
====

=== 5.2 Test Admin

Obtain an Admin token:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
export ADMIN_TOKEN=$(\
    curl -ks -X POST https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=admin&password=admin&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 ) && echo $ADMIN_TOKEN
----

And try again with your new token:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i http://$(oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} get route inventory -o=go-template --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/secured/me/admin \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
----

You should see:

[source,none]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 2256
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Set-Cookie: 2a1b392100b8b2cb3705c68f4ecbaf66=1b3560b80b9fad566e105aff1f31f880; path=/; HttpOnly

Success! We dump all of the claims from the JWT token for inspection.

== 6. Using Keycloak fine-grained Authentication

Frequently, resource servers only perform authorization decisions based on role-based access control (RBAC), where the roles granted to the user trying to access protected resources are checked against the roles mapped to these same resources. While roles are very useful and used by applications, they also have a few limitations:

* Resources and roles are tightly coupled and changes to roles (such as adding, removing, or changing an access context) can impact multiple resources
* Changes to your security requirements can imply deep changes to application code to reflect these changes
* Depending on your application size, role management might become difficult and error-prone

Keycloak's _Authorization Services_ provides fine-grained authorization policies that decouples the authorization policy from your code, so when your policies change, your code doesn't have to. In this exercise we'll use Keycloak's Authorization Services to protect our Quarkus APIs.

=== 6.1 Enable Quarkus Keycloak and OpenID Connect Extensions

First, you'll need to enable the Keycloak extension by running this command in a Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="oidc, keycloak-authorization"
----

You should see:

[source,console]
----
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc has been installed
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-keycloak-authorization has been installed
----

Since we will use Keycloak authentication rather than JWT, we'll need to disable the JWT extension. To remove the extension, run this command in a Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory quarkus:remove-extension -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt"
----

You should see:

[source,console]
----
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-jwt has been uninstalled
----

=== 6.2 Configuring Keycloak Extension

Next, add these to your `application.properties` for Keycloak:

[source,properties,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
# OIDC config

# <1>
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex
# <2>
quarkus.oidc.client-id=backend-service
# <3>
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
# <4>
quarkus.http.cors=true
# <5>
quarkus.tls.trust-all=true
# <6>
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enable=true
# <7>
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.ready.name=Readiness
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.ready.path=/q/health/ready
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.ready.enforcement-mode=DISABLED
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.live.name=Liveness
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.live.path=/q/health/live
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.live.enforcement-mode=DISABLED
----
<1> The address of our OIDC server (Keycloak) including the realm name
<2> Defines which client defined in the realm this application represents
<3> The secrete password (we are using Basic Auth, but there are other, https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-configuration-properties-reference[more secure auth mechanisms])
<4> For simplicity we trust all hosts in this example since we're using self-signed certs. In practice you would not be using self-signed certs, so proper trust chains can be formed.
<5> Enforces and applies Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) headers
<6> Turns on the policy enforcer. It's off by default as it does require configuration (which we've done!)
<7> We explicitly disable authorization checks for the `/health/*` endpoints so that the container platform can access them. To support secured health checks, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/[different health check mechanisms] like TCP or `exec` methods can be used.

This configures the extension with the necessary configuration ( https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_java_adapter_config[read more^] about what these do).

=== 6.3 Create Keycloak endpoints

Create a new class file called `AuthorizedResource.java` in the `com.redhat.coolstore.inventory.controller` package (in the `inventory/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/inventory/controller` directory) with the following code:

[.console-input]
[source,java,role=copypaste]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.inventory.controller;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;

@Path("/secured") // <1>
public class AuthorizedResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity; // <2>


    @GET
    @Path("/confidential") // <3>
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String confidential() {
        return ("confidential access for: " + identity.getPrincipal().getName() +
          " with attributes:" + identity.getAttributes());
    }
}
----
<1> Note that we do not use any `@RolesAllowed` or any other instrumentation on the endpoint to specify access policy. It looks like an ordinary endpoint. Keycloak (the server) is the one enforcing access here, not Quarkus directly.
<2> The `SecurityIdentity` is a generic object produced by the Keycloak extension that you can use to obtain information about the security principals and attributes embedded in the request.
<3> The path defined here aligns with the definition in the Keycloak server for protecting the `/secured/confidential` endpoint. In this case, only user `jdoe` is authorized.

=== 6.4 Rebuild and redeploy app

Let's re-build and re-deploy the application once again. Run this command, which will cause the OpenShift plugin to re-deploy:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
oc project globex-keycloak-{user_name} && \
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory clean package -DskipTests
----

You should see `BUILD SUCCESS`. The new application will begin deploying. Wait for it to complete (dark blue circle for the `inventory` service on the OpenShift web console).

=== 6.5 Test confidential

The `/secured/confidential` endpoint is protected with a policy defined in the Keycloak Server. The policy only grants access to the resource if the user is granted with a `confidential` role. The difference here is that the application is delegating the access decision to Keycloak, so no explicit source code instrumentation is required.

[NOTE]
====
Keycloak caches the resource paths that it is protecting, so that every access doesn't cause a roundtrip back to the server to check whether the user is authorized to access the resource. The lifespan of these cached entries can be controlled through https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_enforcer_filter[Policy Enforcer Configuration^].
====

First make sure even `admin` can't access the endpoint:

Refresh the admin token (it may have expired):

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
export ADMIN_TOKEN=$(\
    curl -ks -X POST https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=admin&password=admin&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 ) && echo $ADMIN_TOKEN
----

And then try to access with it:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i -X GET \
  http://$(oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} get route inventory -o=go-template --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/secured/confidential \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
----

You should see in the returned HTTP headers:

[source,none]
----
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
content-length: 0
set-cookie: xxxxxxxxxxxx; path=/; HttpOnly
----

`Failed` as expected!

To access the confidential endpoint, you should obtain an access token for user `jdoe` (the only user authorized to access this endpoint):

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
export JDOE_TOKEN=$(\
    curl -ks -X POST https://keycloak-globex-keycloak-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=jdoe&password=jdoe&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 ) && echo $JDOE_TOKEN
----

And access the confidential endpoint with your new token:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i -X GET \
  http://$(oc -n globex-keycloak-{user_name} get route inventory -o=go-template --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/secured/confidential \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JDOE_TOKEN"
----

You should see:

[source,none]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 503
content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
set-cookie: 2a1b392100b8b2cb3705c68f4ecbaf66=1bc7e0de32a148dfdf0fc11eff5c9e2c; path=/; HttpOnly

confidential access for: jdoe with attributes:{configuration-metadata=io.quarkus.oidc.OidcConfigurationMetadata@1e3c7d7f, io.quarkus.security.identity.AuthenticationRequestContext=io.quarkus.security.runtime.QuarkusIdentityProviderManagerImpl$1@2bc2d50d, permissions=[Permission {id=99856673-24fa-431b-9e26-93e2113f69db
----

Success! Even though our code did not explicitly protect the `/secured/confidential` endpoint, we can protect arbitrary URLs in Quarkus apps when using Keycloak.

== Congratulations!

This exercise demonstrated how your applications can use Keycloak to protect APIs in your applications. Here we used bearer tokens to authenticate users, `@RolesAllowed` to specify in the app how to restrict access, and Keycloak's fine-grained permissions to product APIs from Keycloak itself.
