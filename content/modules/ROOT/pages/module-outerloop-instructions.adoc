== 1. Get your Developer Workspace
:navtitle: Get your Developer Workspace

In this lab you will learn about providing your Developer Workspace with a Kubernetes-native development platform and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI and OpenShift web console.

=== 1.1 Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {devspaces_dashboard}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_name}
----

* *Password*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_password}
----

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, delete the workspace first.

* *Git Repo URL*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/rh-mad-workshop/coolstore-microservice.git
----

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace coolstore-microservice*. It takes a few minutes to finish the process.

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors`.

You can ignore the warning popup below.

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. *If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.*

Now you are ready to move forward to the next lab!

== 2. 

Please close all but the Workshop Deployer browser tab to avoid proliferation of browser tabs which can make working on other modules difficult. 

Go back to the `Workshop Deployer` browser tab to choose your next module!
