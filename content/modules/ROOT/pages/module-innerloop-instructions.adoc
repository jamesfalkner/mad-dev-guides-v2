== 1. Get your Developer Workspace
:navtitle: Get your Developer Workspace

In this lab you will learn about providing your Developer Workspace with a Kubernetes-native development platform and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI and OpenShift web console.

=== 1.1 Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {devspaces_dashboard}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

image::innerloop/login_with_openshift.png[login,800]

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_name}
----

* *Password*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_password}
----

image::innerloop/che-login.png[login,800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::innerloop/auth-access.png[auth-access, 800]
====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, delete the workspace first.

image::innerloop/ds-delete.png[ds, 800]
====

* *Git Repo URL*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/rh-mad-workshop/coolstore-devx.git
----

image::innerloop/ds-landing.png[ds, 800]

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace coolstore-microservice-devx*. It takes a few minutes to finish the process.

image::innerloop/starting-workspace.png[ds, 800]

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

image::innerloop/ds-workspace.png

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors`.

image::innerloop/ds-trust-popup.png[ds, 800]

You can ignore the warning popup below.

image::innerloop/kubectl-warning-popup.png[ds, 500]

====

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. *If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.*

Now you are ready to move forward to the next lab!

== 2. Create Inventory Service with Quarkus

In this lab you will learn about building a new *Java* microservice using Quarkus.

image::innerloop/coolstore-arch-inventory-quarkus.png[CoolStore Architecture,400]

=== 2.1. What is Quarkus?

image::innerloop/quarkus-logo.png[Quarkus, 600]

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.

Key features of Quarkus include:

* *Container First*: Quarkus tailors your application for GraalVM and HotSpot. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory 
(not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms 
like Kubernetes. We use a technique we call https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot^].
* *Unifies Imperative and Reactive*: Combine both the familiar https://quarkus.io/vision/continuum[imperative code and 
the non-blocking reactive style^] when developing applications.
* *Developer Joy*: A cohesive platform for optimized developer joy: live coding, remote development, zero config, continuous testing, dev services, and Dev UI.
* *Best of Breed Libraries and Standards*: Quarkus brings a cohesive, fun to use full-stack framework by leveraging best of breed libraries you 
love and use wired on a https://quarkus.io/vision/standards[standard backbone^].

=== 2.2. Quarkus Maven Project

The *inventory-quarkus* project has the following structure which shows the components of the Quarkus project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

image::innerloop/inventory-quarkus-project.png[Inventory Project,600]

When you explore the `pom.xml`, You will find the import of the Quarkus BOM, allowing you to omit the version on the different Quarkus dependencies. In addition, you can see the following extensions in the `pom.xml`.

[.console-output]
[source,xml]
----
   <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-rest</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-rest-jsonb</artifactId>

    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-openshift</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

* https://quarkus.io/guides/rest[Quarkus REST^] is a new Jakarta REST (formerly known as JAX-RS) implementation written from the ground up to work on our common Vert.x layer and is thus fully reactive.
* https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-json-guide[JSON REST Services^] allows you to develop REST services to consume and produce JSON payloads.
* https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache[Hibernate ORM with Panache^] is the de facto JPA implementation and offers you the full breath of an Object Relational Mapper. With Panache you will get additional convenience features. 
* https://quarkus.io/guides/datasource-guide#h2[Datasources (H2)^] allows you to use datasources is the main way of obtaining connections to a database.
* https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-openshift[OpenShift^] understands how to deploy an application to OpenShift

Examine `src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/InventoryResource.java` file:

[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class InventoryResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

It's a very simple REST endpoint, returning `hello` to requests on `/hello`.

[TIP]
====
With Quarkus, there is no need to create an Application class. It is supported, but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different *Scoped* annotations  (ApplicationScoped, RequestScoped, etc). In addition, Quarkus is able to mix and match Reactive and Imperative programming, so you won't have to worry about the reactive aspect of the REST service.
====

=== 2.3. Enable the Development Mode

*quarkus:dev* runs Quarkus in development mode. This enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will 
automatically take effect. This works for resource files like the configuration property file as well. Refreshing the browser 
triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected, the affected Java files are recompiled and the application is redeployed; 
your request is then serviced by the redeployed application. If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.

Open a new terminal in your VSCode workspace.

image::innerloop/ds-terminal-view.png[Che - RunTask, 600]

Start the Quarkus  dev mode by running the following Maven commands in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/inventory-quarkus quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.analytics.disabled=true
----

When pop-ups appear, click on `yes` to listen 8080 port. Then, click on `x` not to redirect to the *5005* port.

image::innerloop/che-open-8080-link.png[Che - Open Link, 600]

You then have to click on `Open in New Tab > Open` to access the frontend page.

image::innerloop/vscode-external-website.png[Che - Open Link, 600]

Your browser will be directed to *your Inventory Service running inside your Workspace*.

image::innerloop/inventory-quarkus.png[Inventory Quarkus,800]

[NOTE]
====
Please *don't close* that Inventory output browser tab, you will need it for the next few steps of this lab.

If by accident you close that browser tab then you should be able to reopen it from your browser history. It will likely be called *Inventory Service*
====

Now let's write some code and create an Entity to interact with the Database and a REST endpoint to create the Inventory service

=== 2.4. Create an Entity

Open the `src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/Inventory.java` file and copy the following code.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative;

import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheEntity;
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Table;

@Entity // <1> 
@Table(name = "INVENTORY") // <2> 
public class Inventory extends PanacheEntity { // <3>

    public String itemId; // <4>
    public int quantity; 

}
----
<1> *@Entity* marks the class as a JPA entity
<2> *@Table* customizes the table creation process by defining a table name and database constraint
<3> *PanacheEntity* is a very useful super class that, among others, autogenerates an id field
<4> *public String itemId* defines the name of a field. https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache#how-and-why-we-simplify-hibernate-orm-mappings[Panache will rewrite the access to private] and generate getters and setters during runtime, allowing you to eliminate a lot of boilerplate code.

[NOTE]
====
You don't need to press a save button! VS Code automatically saves the changes made to the files.
====

Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to match with the following content:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
quarkus.datasource.db-kind=h2
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:mem:inventory;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
quarkus.datasource.username=sa
quarkus.datasource.password=sa
quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create
quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.sql=true
quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script=import.sql
quarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0
----

<1> An *uber-jar* contains all the dependencies required packaged in the *jar* to enable running the 
application with *java -jar*. By default, in Quarkus, the generation of the uber-jar is disabled. With the
*%prod* prefix, this option is only activated when building the jar intended for deployments.
<2> Additional configuration to allow the quarkus-maven-plugin to build 
and then deploy this application to OpenShift - but more of that later

Update the `src/main/resources/import.sql` file as follows:

[.console-input]
[source,sql,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (1, '100000', 0);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (2, '329299', 35);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (3, '329199', 12);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (4, '165613', 45);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (5, '165614', 87);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (6, '165954', 43);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (7, '444434', 32);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY VALUES (8, '444435', 53);
----

=== 2.5. Create a REST Service

Quarkus uses JAX-RS standard for building REST services. 

Modify the `src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/InventoryResource.java` file to match with:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/api/inventory")
@ApplicationScoped
public class InventoryResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/{itemId}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Inventory getAvailability(@PathParam("itemId") String itemId) {
        Inventory inventory = Inventory.findById(itemId);
        return inventory;
    }
}
----

The above REST service defines an endpoint that is accessible via *HTTP GET* at for example */api/inventory/329299* with the last path param being the product id with which we can check the inventory status.

=== 2.6. Test the REST Service

Go back to the Inventory output browser and click on `Test it`. You should have the following output.

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 329299,
  "itemId": "35",
  "quantity": 2
}
----

The REST API returned a JSON object representing the inventory count for this product. Congratulations!

[NOTE]
====
You may have noticed that there are test classes in the project (test/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/InventoryResourceTest.java). Since we changed our code these tests are now broken. Feel free to fix them if you want an extra challenge (or you can ignore the broken tests if you just want to move on). TIP: you can enable live testing while in dev mode by pressing the letter 'r'.
====

Enter `Ctrl+c` in the existing terminal window to stop the Quarkus Dev Mode.

=== 2.7. Deploy on OpenShift

Using the Quarkus-maven-plugin, the Quarkus https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-openshift[OpenShift Extension] and Source to Image (S2I)
it's time to deploy your service on OpenShift using all that information in the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file
we saw earlier.

In this section you will locally build a `.jar` file, then *create* the OpenShift build and deployment components and *push* the _.jar_ file to OpenShift. The OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^] builder 
will then package the _.jar_ file into a container and run it.

*Append* the folowing information to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
# these value are recommended for a quarkus openshift plugin build

%prod.quarkus.http.cors=true
----
<1> Exposes an external route to access the application
<2> Deploy the application to OpenShift
<3> Tells Openshift to create a secure (HTTPS) route

You can now *build* and *deploy* your application code/binary to OpenShift. By watching the log output you should see this activity:

* Build the jar file
* Push the jar file to OpenShift
* Create OpenShift deployment components
* Build a container using a Dockerfile/Containerfile
* Push this container image to the OpenShift registry
* Deploying the application to OpenShift

Run the following `oc` command and https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling[Quarkus CLI^] in the terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc project globex-innerloop-{user_name} && quarkus build --no-tests 
----

The output should end with `BUILD SUCCESS`. Make sure it’s actually done rolling out.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc rollout status -w deployment/inventory-coolstore
----

The output should look like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
deployment "inventory-coolstore" successfully rolled out
----

=== 2.8. Test your Service

In the {openshift_cluster_console}/topology/ns/globex-innerloop-{user_name}?view=graph[OpenShift web console^, role=params-link], from the *Developer view*, click on the `Open URL` icon of the Inventory Service.

[TIP]
====
You can log in to the OpenShift web console with your credntials (`{user_name}` / `{user_password}`).
====

image::innerloop/openshift-inventory-topology.png[]

Your browser will be redirected to *your Inventory Service running on OpenShift*.

image::innerloop/inventory-quarkus.png[Inventory Quarkus,800]

Then you should be able to test your service by clicking on `Test it`. You should see the following output on the page.

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 329299,
  "itemId": "35",
  "quantity": 2
}
----

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab, but before you go, you probably should close those Inventory Service output browser tabs from the beginning of this chapter.

== 3. Create Catalog Service with Spring Boot

In this lab we will build a second microservice for our application
using Spring Boot. During this lab, you will create a REST API for 
the Catalog service in order to provide a list of products for the CoolStore online shop.

image::innerloop/coolstore-arch-catalog-spring-boot.png[CoolStore Architecture, 400]

=== 3.1. What is Spring Boot?

image::innerloop/spring-boot-logo.png[Spring Boot, 500]

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based applications with embedded web containers. Spring Boot also allows producing a war file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries 
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.

=== 3.2. Spring Boot Maven Project 

The *catalog-spring-boot* project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the Spring Boot project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices. 

For the duration of this lab you will be working in the *catalog-spring-boot* directories shown below:

image::innerloop/springboot-catalog-project.png[Catalog Project,600]

This is a minimal Spring Boot project with support for REST services and Spring Data with JPA for connecting to a database. This project currently contains no code other than the main class, **CatalogApplication** which is there to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

The database is configured using the Spring application configuration file which is located at *src/main/resources/application.properties*. Examine this file to see the database connection details and note that an in-memory H2 database is used in this lab for local development and will be replaced
with a PostgreSQL database in the following labs. More on that later.

Let's create a domain model, data repository, and a REST endpoint to create the Catalog service:

image::innerloop/springboot-catalog-arch.png[Catalog REST Service,800]

=== 3.3. Create the Domain Model

Add the following code to the `src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/catalog/Product.java` file. 

[source,java,role=copypaste]
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import java.io.Serializable;

import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
import jakarta.persistence.Table;

@Entity // <1> 
@Table(name = "PRODUCT") // <2> 
public class Product implements Serializable {
  
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @Id // <3> 
  private String itemId;
  private String name;
  private String description;
  private double price;

  public Product() {}
  
  public String getItemId() {
    return itemId;
  }
  public void setItemId(String itemId) {
    this.itemId = itemId;
  }
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  public String getDescription() {
    return description;
  }
  public void setDescription(String description) {
    this.description = description;
  }
  public double getPrice() {
    return price;
  }
  public void setPrice(double price) {
    this.price = price;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Product [itemId=" + itemId + ", name=" + name + ", price=" + price + "]";
  }
}
----
<1> *@Entity* marks the class as a JPA entity
<2> *@Table* customizes the table creation process by defining a table name and database constraint
<3> *@Id* marks the primary key for the table

=== 3.4. Create a Data Repository

Create a new Java interface named *ProductRepository* in *com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog* package 
and extend https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html[CrudRepository^] interface in order to indicate to Spring that you want to expose a complete set of methods to manipulate the entity.

Add the following code to the `src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/catalog/ProductRepository.java` file.

[.console-input]
[source,java,role=copypaste]
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface ProductRepository extends CrudRepository<Product, String> {} // <1>
----

<1> https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html[CrudRepository^] interface in order to indicate to Spring that you want to expose a complete set of methods to manipulate the entity

That's it! Now that you have a domain model and a repository to retrieve the domain model, let's create a REST service that returns the list of products.

=== 3.5. Create a REST Service

Spring Boot uses Spring Web MVC as the default REST stack in Spring applications. 

Add the following code to the `src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/catalog/CatalogController.java` file.

[.console-input]
[source,java,role=copypaste]
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Spliterator;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.StreamSupport;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;

@CrossOrigin
@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/api/catalog") // <1> 
public class CatalogController {

    @Autowired // <2> 
    private ProductRepository repository; // <3> 

    @ResponseBody
    @GetMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public List<Product> getAll() {
        Spliterator<Product> products = repository.findAll().spliterator();
        return StreamSupport.stream(products, false).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
----

<1> *@RequestMapping* indicates the above REST service defines an endpoint that is accessible via *HTTP GET* at */api/catalog*
<2> Spring Boot automatically provides an implementation for *ProductRepository* at runtime and injects it into the 
controller using the 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection.html[*@Autowired*^] annotation.
<3> the *repository* attribute on the controller class is used to retrieve the list of products from the databases. 

Now, let's build and package the updated *Catalog Service* using the following commands.

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
cd $PROJECT_SOURCE/catalog-spring-boot &&
mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

Once done, you can conviently run your service using Spring Boot maven plugin and test the endpoint.

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

When pop-ups appear, click on `yes` to listen 8080 port. Then, click on `Open in New Tab > Open` to access the frontend page. Then, your browser will be directed to *your Catalog Service running inside your Workspace*.

image::innerloop/catalog-service.png[Catalog Service,800]

Then click on `Test it`. You should have similar output to this array of json:

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----

  {
    "id": "100000",
    "name": "Red Fedora",
    "description": "Official Red Hat Fedora",
    "price": 34.99
  },
  {
    "id": "329299",
    "name": "Quarkus T-shirt",
    "description": "This updated unisex essential fits like a well-loved favorite, featuring a crew neck, short sleeves and designed with superior combed and ring- spun cotton.",
    "price": 10.0
  },
....
----

Well done! The REST API returned a JSON object representing the product list. 

*Stop* the Service by pressing `Ctrl+c` in the terminal window.

=== 3.6. Deploy on OpenShift

It's time to deploy your service on OpenShift. We are going to use Eclipse https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/openshift-maven-plugin/[JKube] to define the build and deployment process on OpenShift, but ultimately we will end up using OpenShift source-to-image (S2I) to package up the _.jar_ file into a container and run it.

The JKube configuration for the Catalog application is present in the *pom.xml* file. Feel free to explore the different configuration values in your source code.

[.console-output]
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jkube</groupId>
    <artifactId>openshift-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.16.1</version>
    (..)
</plugin>
----

Let's Deploy the catalog service to the OpenShift cluster. Run the following command from the terminal window.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn package -DskipTests oc:build oc:resource oc:apply
----

You'll see that the build phase comprises of a few actions:

* Package the application
* Push the jar file to OpenShift
* Create OpenShift deployment components
* Build a container using a Dockerfile/Containerfile
* Push this container image to the OpenShift registry
* Deploying the application to OpenShift

Once this completes, your application should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of the application in one or more pods (the unit of deployment in Kubernetes/Openshift which consists of one or more containers). 

=== 3.7. Test the Catalog Service

Go back to the `Topology` view and click on the `Open URL` icon of the Catalog Service.

image::innerloop/openshift-catalog-topology.png[]

Your browser will be redirected to *your Catalog Service running on OpenShift*.

image::innerloop/catalog-service.png[Catalog Service,800]

Then click on `Test it`. You should have many lines of output similar to this array of json:

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----

  {
    "id": "100000",

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.

== 4. Create Gateway Service with .NET

In this lab you will learn how you can build microservices using ASP.NET Core. During this lab you will create a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs.

image::innerloop/coolstore-arch-gateway-dotnet.png[CoolStore Architecture,400]

=== 4.1. What is .NET?

image::innerloop/240px-NET_Core_Logo.png[.NET, 400]

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction/[.NET (Core)^] is a 
is a free, open-source development platform for building many kinds of apps, from web, serverless, mobile, desktop and console apps.

You can create .NET apps for many operating systems, including Windows, Linux and MacOS on a variety of hardware. .NET lets you use platform-specific capabilities, such as operating system APIs. Examples are Windows Forms and WPF on Windows .NET is open source, https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT[using MIT and Apache 2 licenses^] .NET is a project of the https://dotnetfoundation.org/[.NET Foundation^].

pass:[.NET] supports a number of programming faces and development environments, but today we will be looking at C# inside OpenShift Dev Spaces.

We will also be using the standard web server pattern provided by ASP .NET libraries for creating non-blocking web services.

=== 4.2. .NET Gateway Project 

The *gateway-dotnet* project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the project laid out in different subdirectories according to ASP .NET best practices:

image::innerloop/dotnet-gateway-project.png[Gateway Project,340]

This is a minimal .NET project with support for asynchronous REST services. 

Examine `Startup.cs` file in the *gateway-dotnet* directory.

See how the basic web server is started with minimal services, health checks and a basic REST controller is deployed.

    });

    services.AddHealthChecks();
    services.AddControllersWithViews();

    ProductsController.Config();

    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseCors(builder => builder
            .AllowAnyOrigin ()
            .AllowAnyHeader ()

        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });

}

----

Examine `ProductsController.cs` file in the *gateway-dotnet/Controllers* directory.

[.console-output]
[source,java]
----
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")] // <1>
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Products> Get()
    {            
        private static HttpClient catalogHttpClient = new HttpClient(); // <4>
        private static HttpClient inventoryHttpClient = new HttpClient(); 

        try
        {
            // get the product list
            IEnumerable<Products> productsList = GetCatalog(); // <2>

            // update each item with their inventory value
            foreach(Products p in productsList) // <3>
            {
                Inventory inv = GetInventory(p.ItemId);
                if (inv != null)
                    p.Availability = new Availability(inv);
            }    

            return productsList;
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Using Catalog service: " + catalogApiHost + " and Inventory service: " + inventoryApiHost);
            Console.WriteLine("Failure to get service data: " + e.Message);
            // on failures return error
            throw e;
        }
    }

    private IEnumerable<Products> GetCatalog()
    { 
        var data = catalogHttpClient.GetStringAsync("/api/catalog").Result; 
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IEnumerable<Products>>(data);
    }
    
    private Inventory GetInventory(string itemId)
    {
        var data = inventoryHttpClient.GetStringAsync("/api/inventory/" + itemId).Result;
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Inventory>(data);
    }

}
----

<1> Not unlike the Quarkus and Spring boot apps previously built, the ProductsController has a single defined REST entrypoint for GET */api/products*
<2> In this case the Get() service first requests a list of products from the Catalog microservice
<3> It then steps through each in turn to discover the amount of product in stock. It does this by calling the Inventory service for each product.
<4> By using an HttpClient class for each service, .NET will efficiently manage the connection handling.

The location or binding to the existing Catalog and Inventory REST services is determined at runtime.

=== 4.3. Deploy the Gateway service to OpenShift

It's time to build and deploy your service on OpenShift. 

As you did previously for the Inventory and Catalog services in the earlier chapters, you need to *build a new Component and then Deploy it in to the OpenShift cluster*.

We are still going to use OpenShift S2I, but this time we will invoke it using the OpenShift CLI (oc commands). We will also get S2I to compile the application, create the .NET artefact .dll and then create a container.

There are two ways to get OpenShift S2I to build from source:

* Point S2I at the git repo of the source code
* Upload the source code and get S2I to build from that

Since we are exploring the Inner Loop and we might have made code changes locally in the IDE we will use the "Upload" method.
We will go through 4 steps to get the Gateway service running:

* Create an S2I Build for the .NET application with `oc new-build`
* Start the build by uploading the source with `oc start-build`
* Create a new application (a deployment) in OpenShift for the application with `oc new-app`
* Expose the application using a Route (so that we can easily test it) with `oc expose`

xecute the following commands in the terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd $PROJECT_SOURCE/gateway-dotnet

oc new-build dotnet:7.0 --name gateway-coolstore  \
  --labels=component=gateway \
  --env DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT=app.csproj --binary=true

oc start-build gateway-coolstore --from-dir=. -w 

oc new-app gateway-coolstore:latest --name gateway-coolstore  --labels=app=coolstore,app.kubernetes.io/instance=gateway,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=coolstore,app.kubernetes.io/name=gateway,app.openshift.io/runtime=dotnet,component=gateway 

oc create route edge gateway-coolstore --service=gateway-coolstore
----

Once this completes, your application should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of the application in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running containers for the project. 

=== 4.4. Test the Gateway Service

Go back to the `Topology` view and click on the `Open URL` icon of the *Gateway* Service.

image::innerloop/openshift-gateway-topology.png[]

Your browser will be redirected to *your Gateway Service running on OpenShift*.

image::innerloop/gateway-service.png[Gateway Service,800]

Then click on `Test it`. You should have an array of json output like this but with many more products.

Look in the json to see how the *Gateway service* has combined the *product* information together with the *inventory* (quantity) information: 

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "itemId": "100000",
    "name": "Red Fedora",
    "description": "Official Red Hat Fedora",
    "price": 34.99,
    "availability": {
      "quantity": 1
    }
  },
  {
    "itemId": "329299",
    "name": "Quarkus T-shirt",
    "description": "This updated unisex essential fits like a well-loved favorite, featuring a crew neck, short sleeves and designed with superior combed and ring- spun cotton.",
    "price": 10,
    "availability": {
      "quantity": 2
    }
  },
....
]
----

=== 4.5. Service discovery

You might be wondering how the Gateway service knows how to contact the *Catalog* and *Inventory* services. These values can be injected as environment variables at runtime for example if running the component locally in the IDE, but by default we have hardcoded the name of the OpenShift *Services* and then use OpenShift local DNS to resolve these names as 
the application starts. You can see the code that consumes those variables below. This is from *ProductsController.cs class* in the 
*/gateway-dotnet/* directory.

[.console-output]
[source,java]
----
public static void Config()
{
    try
    {
        // discover the URL of the services we are going to call
        catalogApiHost = "http://" + 
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_CATALOG_COOLSTORE_HOST", 
                "catalog-coolstore") + ":" +
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_CATALOG_COOLSTORE_PORT", 
                "8080");                   
        
        inventoryApiHost = "http://" +
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_INVENTORY_COOLSTORE_HOST", 
                "inventory-coolstore") + ":" +
            GetEnvironmentVariable("COMPONENT_INVENTORY_COOLSTORE_PORT", 
                "8080");

        // set up the Http conection pools
        inventoryHttpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(inventoryApiHost);
        catalogHttpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(catalogApiHost);
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Checking catalog api URL " + catalogApiHost);
        Console.WriteLine("Checking inventory api URL " + inventoryApiHost);
        Console.WriteLine("Failure to build location URLs for Catalog and Inventory services: " + e.Message);
        throw;
    }
}
----

You can try this simple name service discovery for yourself in the Gateway service pod by *selecting the Gateway service and then the running Pod*.

image::innerloop/openshift-gateway-pod.png[Gateway Service,800]

You can test the connectivity by `*selecting the Pod Terminal*` and by `*executing these shell commands in the terminal window:*`

image::innerloop/openshift-gateway-pod-terminal.png[Gateway Service,800]

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl -w "\n" http://inventory-coolstore:8080/api/inventory/329299
----

The outpout should look similar to:

[.console-output]
[source,sh]
----
{"id":329299,"itemId":"35","quantity":2}
----

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.

== 5. Deploy Web UI with with Node.js and AngularJS

In this lab you will deploy the Node.js and Angular-based web frontend for the CoolStore online shop which uses the API Gateway services you deployed 
in previous labs. 

image::innerloop/coolstore-arch-webui-nodejs.png[API Gateway Pattern,400]

=== 5.1. What is Node.js?

image::innerloop/nodejs-logo.png[Node.js, 400]

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side applications using JavaScript. https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] has an event-driven architecture capable of 
non-blocking I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time web applications.

=== 5.2. Deploy on OpenShift

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the certified Node.js container image available in OpenShift. 

In this lab, you will use OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^] again. OpenShift will obtain the application code directly from the source repository and then build and deploy a 
container image of it.

For a change, rather than using the CLI option you will start this process from the web console.

Click on `+Add` in the Topology view and select `Import from Git`.

image::innerloop/openshift-add-from-git.png[OpenShift - Add from Git]

Then, enter the following information:

.Import from Git

image::innerloop/git-import-2.png[git-import, 800]
image::innerloop/git-import-3.png[git-import, 800]

From the advanced Routing options `*select the Secure Route option*` and set TLS termination to "Edge", so this creates an *HTTPS* route. 

image::innerloop/openshift-add-https-route.png[OpenShift - Add route, 800]

Click on `Create` to create the application. 

Now wait a few minutes for the application to built by OpenShift and deployed to your project. In the toplogy view, 
the web application pod will not be ready until the blue ring goes dark blue.

=== 5.3 Test the Web Service

In the OpenShift web topology view, click on the `Open URL` icon of the Web Service.

image::innerloop/openshift-web-topology.png[]

Your browser will be redirected to *your Web Service running on OpenShift. You should be able to see the CoolStore application with all products and their inventory status.

image::innerloop/coolstore-web.png[]

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the Web UI on OpenShift.

== Summary

In this module, you have learned how to develop ployglot microservices with Java (Quarkus and Spring Boot), Nodejs, and .Net. Then, you have practiced how to build, test, and deploy those applications to OpenShift.
