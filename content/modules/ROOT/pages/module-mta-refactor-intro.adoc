[NOTE]
====
If you've already completed the introduction exercise in the previous module, feel free to skip to the 'Refactor' lab. This exercise is meant to introduce you to the environment and confirm your services are running correctly.
====

A common way of speaking about migrating or modernizing workloads to the cloud has been coined as the *6 Rs framework*. This framework can be broken down as follows.

image::mta-refactor/mod-strategies-refactor.png[Modernization Strategies]

For a Refactor (including rewrites or re-architectures),Red Hat helps our customers' application modernization journey with this approach:

* Iteratively strangle services into individual observable microservices running in separate containers.
* More productive developers via fast inner loop development. Faster startup time using link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[cloud-native runtimes^] (e.g. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus[Quarkus^], link:https://access.redhat.com/products/spring-boot[Spring Boot^])
* Isolated domains allow for faster iteration, recovery of services, efficient scalability, and ability to experiment more quickly.
* Basis to begin integrating with application services for greater innovation and reach at lower costs

This module will walk you through 2 of the phases (_Refactor_, _Deployment_) as follows:

* Refactor the legacy application (*Customers*) to fix the legacy configuration issue in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/6.0/html-single/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_applications/index[Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)^] Analysis report
* Deploy the modernized applications to OpenShift using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/cicd/index#builds-binary-source_creating-build-inputs[OpenShift Binary Build and Deployment^]

== 1.1. Understand the Globex Retail System Architecture

Globex is a fictional company we will use for this workshop. The Globex system in your workshop environment consists of microservices applications that are deployed across multiple platforms such as virtual machines and a container platform as depicted below.

image::mta-refactor/architecture_initial_m2.png[architecture_initial_m2]

Your initial state for this workshop is an environment that is spread over Legacy Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Your application has already been partially moved from your legacy environments to OpenShift.

The Globex retail application consists of a _Node.js_ frontend service which is getting its data via a gateway service. The gateway service is connected to three backend services: customers, orders and inventory. Each service uses its own database to store data.

The services running on OpenShift are deployed in a namespace `retail-%USERID%`. You will eventually manage these services using *OpenShift GitOps* and *Pipelines* in later modules.

[NOTE]
====
You might see the customers pods are in a failed state due to _ImagePullBackOff Error_. It will be automatically fixed when you finish the OpenShift CI/CD and GitOps sections later.
====

All source code for the applications as well as the GitOps YAML manifests for all services are stored in a (Git-compatible) *Gitea* repository that for workshop purposes is hosted on the OpenShift cluster.

The problem right now is in the *customers* service:

* The customers service uses an old Java code base running on Apache Tomcat in a VM on Legacy Virtualization. In this module you will assess and analyze this legacy Java application to learn the best way to modernize the Java code and then deploy the application to OpenShift on top of Red Hat JBoss Web Server.
* The customers database is using an PostgreSQL database running as a VM in Legacy Virtualization. The IT Ops team at Globex want to keep running the PostgreSQL database on virtualization environment rather than containerization. Therefore, you will lift and shift the VM to OpenShift Virtualization using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization.

Once you have finished the all of the modules in this workshop, your deployment architecture will look like this:

== 1.2. Workshop Environment

=== 1.2.1. Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::mta-refactor/alreadyset.png[alreadyset]

If your `username` is properly set, then you can move on. *If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned* like this:

image::mta-refactor/setuser.png[setuser]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just update your username in the URL parameters (e.g., `1-introduction.html?USERID=%USERID%` )

[IMPORTANT]
====
You have to use *an unique username* (e.g. `%USERID%`) while you're running the hands-on labs. For example, you need to deploy applications to your own project (e.g. retail-%USERID%).
====

=== 1.2.2. OpenShift Cluster

Your OpenShift cluster is already configured with everything you need. Here are the details:

* `Gitea` to host the source code repositories
* `OpenShift Virtualization` to ultimately run the migrated PostgreSQL VM
* `OpenShift GitOps` to manage the deployed services using a GitOps approach through ArgoCD
* `OpenShift Pipelines` to build the customer application from source code and deploy to the `retail` project using GitOps
* `Migration Toolkit for Applications` to help modernize the customer service.

=== 1.2.3. Visual Studio Code Server

VSCode is already deployed in the OpenShift cluster for you you to use as your IDE. This means you don't need to install and configure anything on your system. This makes it easy to change source code and configuration files in the cloned repository.

To get started, access the link:https://codeserver-codeserver-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[VS Code server instance^] and log in using the following `password`.

* Password: `{openshift-password}`

image::mta-refactor/vscode-server-login.png[vscode-server-login]

The graphical user interface (GUI) should look like:

image::mta-refactor/vscode.png[VSCode]

== 1.3. Explore the Globex Retail Services (GUI)

Confirm you're able to access the retail services application by accessing its frontend web application. To find the URL to access the *Frontend* application, you need to use the OpenShift command line tool (`oc`). Go to the VS Code server and Open a new terminal that already installed the _oc_ command by default.

Click on `New Terminal` in Terminal menu in the VS Code. Once a new terminal is open, run the following _oc_ command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p openshift https://openshift.default.svc:443
----

image::mta-refactor/vscode-terminal.png[vscode-terminal]

[NOTE]
====
If you see a popup message about allowing copy/paste, *"See text and images copied to the clipboard"*, click on `Allow`. Then you might also see `"Use insecure connections?"` message in the terminal. In case, press `y`.
====

Find the `Route` URL for the *Frontend* application. Run the following `oc` command in the VS Code server terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get route ordersfrontend -n retail-%USERID%
----

The output should look like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
NAME             HOST/PORT                                                                PATH   SERVICES         PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
ordersfrontend   ordersfrontend-retail-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%          ordersfrontend   web    edge/Redirect   None
----

Navigate to the orders frontend route by entering the hostname listed above under `HOST/PORT` into your browser's address bar.

image::mta-refactor/frontend.png[Frontend]

Click through the three panels on the left.

* `Customers` shows the list of the customer information such as _fullname, city, country, and username_.
* `Orders` shows current order information including relevant customer data.
* `Products` shows the current inventory information.

== 1.4. Access the Customer Data

The legacy environment not only has the PostgreSQL Database VM deployed but it also hosts another VM which runs the old customer application on top of Apache Tomcat.

From a terminal window you can use `curl` to demonstrate that the application is connected to the database.

Use the IP Address of the *Customer Service (Tomcat VM)* to access the customer service. Run the following _curl_ command in the VS Code server's terminal {or your local environment since the Tomcat IP address is publicly accessible).

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://%TOMCATIP%:8080/customers-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/customers/1 ; echo
----

The output should look like:

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"username":"phlegm_master_19","name":"Guybrush","surname":"Threepwood","address":"1060 West Addison","zipCode":"ME-001","city":"Melee Town","country":"Melee Island"}
----

Try to get another customer data.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://%TOMCATIP%:8080/customers-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/customers/2 ; echo
----

The output should look like:

[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
{"id":2,"username":"hate_guybrush","name":"Pirate","surname":"Lechuck","address":"Caverns of Meat, no number","zipCode":"MO-666","city":"Giant Monkey Head","country":"Monkey Island"}
----

== 1.5 Change the Working Project

Make sure to *check out* to the right branch, `patch-postgre` that you'll go through this module today! Run the following `git` command in the VS Code terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
git checkout patch-postgres
----

The output should be something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
branch 'patch-postgres' set up to track 'origin/patch-postgres'.
Switched to a new branch 'patch-postgres'
----

== Congratulations!

You have now successfully learned about the architecture of the application and confirmed your workshop environment.

In the next step, you'll continue the modernization process by analyzing the source code of one of the applications and refactor it to run as a Linux container on OpenShift.
