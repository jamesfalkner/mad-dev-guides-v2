== The evolution of modern application development and how to revolutionize your journey

It can be challenging to learn new products and technologies through various technical materials such as blogs, documentation, videos, and even trial experience. In this workshop we'll take you through the recommended paths that are organized based on high-level use cases, various target personas, and your journey stages.

For example, your journey of modern application development can be combined or remixed as needed from accelerating inner loop development to expanding the outer loop with GitOps, building a developer hub, developing AI/ML, and advanced cloud-native app development with service mesh, serverless, and service interconnect.

== Understanding the Globex Retail System Architecture

`Globex` is a fictional company we will use for this workshop. The Globex system in your workshop environment consists of microservices applications (`Coolstore`) that are deployed across multiple platforms such as virtual machines and a container platform as depicted below.

Your initial state for this workshop is an environment that is spread over Legacy Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Your application has already been partially moved from your legacy environments to OpenShift.

The Globex retail application consists of a _Node.js_ frontend service which is getting its data via a gateway service. The gateway service is connected to three backend services: customers, orders and inventory. Each service uses its own database to store data.

All source code for the applications as well as the OpenShift (Kubernetes) manifests for all services are stored in a (Git-compatible) *Gitea* repository that for workshop purposes is hosted on the OpenShift cluster.

The problem right now is in the *customers* service:

* The customers service uses an old Java code base running on Apache Tomcat in a `VM on Legacy Virtualization`. In this module you will assess and analyze this legacy Java application to learn the best way to modernize the Java code and then deploy the application to OpenShift on top of Red Hat JBoss Web Server.
* The customers database is using an PostgreSQL database running as a VM in Legacy Virtualization. The IT Ops team at Globex want to keep running the PostgreSQL database on virtualization environment rather than containerization. Therefore, you will lift and shift the VM to OpenShift Virtualization using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization.

Once you have finished the all of the modules in this workshop, your deployment architecture will look like this:

You will be able to access the frontend web application in the Globex system when you go through the workshop.

* `Customers` shows the list of the customer information such as _fullname, city, country, and username_.
* `Orders` shows current order information including relevant customer data.
* `Products` shows the current inventory information.

== Ready to Hands-on!

You have now successfully learned about the architecture of the application and confirmed your workshop environment.

In the next step, you'll begin the application modernization journey by choosing the modules that you want to learn today.

Please close all but the Workshop Deployer browser tab to avoid proliferation of browser tabs which can make working on other modules difficult.
