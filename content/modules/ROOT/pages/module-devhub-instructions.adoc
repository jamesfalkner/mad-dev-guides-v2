== 1. Application Modernization

This lab aims to learn how developers can modernize their applications quickly by moving them into the OpenShift Application Platform with Red Hat Developer Hub. *Red Hat Developer Hub* is already configured with *Red Hat Single Sign-On*, *OpenShift Pipelines*, *OpenShift GitOps*, and *GitLab*. In this section you will migrate all the backend microservices that are part of the *Cool Store Application* with just a few clicks using Red Hat Developer Hub.

*Module goals*:

* Create a component for a *Quarkus Java Application* using existing *software templates*. 
* Overview of application details, exploring topology view, pipelines information in RHDH.
* Overview of source code repository created.
* Create a component for a *Spring Boot Java Application* using existing *software templates*. 
* Overview of application details, exploring topology view, pipelines information from RHDH to *OpenShift*.

== 1.1. Globexâ€™s Digital Transformation Journey
Globex, a fictitious retail company, has completed the modernization of its existing retail e-commerce web application as part of its modernization journey.

As part of the modernization process, Globex is looking to accelerate the software development lifecycle with best practices to reduce time to market.  

*Note*:The following services have an embedded database perfect for development. You do not need to set up the database for this lab.

== 1.2. Move the Java Quarkus application: Inventory

=== 1.2.1. Use Software Templates to build and deploy your first Quarkus application

* From the left menu, click on *Create*:

* Select the *Quarkus Backend Application* Template:

image::devhub/software_template_quarkus.png[width=50%]  

Follow the next steps to create a component based on the pre-defined Software Templates:

*Step 1* - Provide information about the GitLab location :

* *Repo Host*: is the GitLab domain already installed in OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

** Replace the *Repo Host* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
gitlab-gitlab.%SUBDOMAIN%
----

image::devhub/st_gitlab_info.png[width=65%]  

* *Repo Group*: is the GitLab organization already configured. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

* Click on *Next Step*

*Step 2* - Provide information about the Cluster Id:

* *Cluster Id*: is the OpenShift domain. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application.

** Replace the *Cluster Id* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
.%SUBDOMAIN%
----

image::devhub/st_component_clusterid.png[width=65%]  

* *Namespace*:  is the OpenShift namespace. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application in that namespace.

** Replace the *N* with the user number:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
rhdhub-%USERID%
----

image::devhub/st_component_namespace.png[width=40%]  

*Note*: Each lab participant is already assigned a unique namespace to be used for all the applications. Each application will have a shared identification based on your user name. 

* *Owner*: The owner is your user ID. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data in the build and deployment process.
** Write your user id: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
%USERID%
----

image::devhub/st_component_owner.png[width=40%]  

* Click on *Next Step*

*Step 3* - Provide Build information:
