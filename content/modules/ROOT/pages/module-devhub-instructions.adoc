* *Learning Paths*: Developers and DevOps can utilize customer learning paths to learn and advance their skills.

** Search for the *Learning Path*: *Developing with Quarkus*
** Click on the link. 

image::devhub/learning_paths_explore.png[]  

* Continue exploring the menu:

** Go back to the https://developer-hub-backstage-globex-devhub.{openshift_subdomain}[Red Hat Developer Hub UI^]

* *Clusters*: will show your managed clusters. At this time, we are not using https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes^] for cluster management. You will see a message: *Could not fetch clusters from Hub*.

* *Tech Radar*: Company radar to understand their modernization technology landscape. This information will be customized by each company. For more information, visit our product page https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_hub/1.1/html/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/rhdh-installing-dynamic-plugins[about plugins configuration^]

image::devhub/tech_radar.png[] 

* *Create*: Developers can build and deploy their applications by creating a component by choosing a pre-defined template. You will spend most of your time during this module on this feature.

image::devhub/software_templates_all.png[] 

*Software Templates* are built based on best practices to create a repeatable process for developers.

Find more information about the Red Hat Developer Hub https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh[here^].

=== 1.3. Explore Software Templates

Each Software Template is already built based on Application architectures and frameworks such as Quarkus, Spring Boot, and Angular. 
The templates are composed of everything that is required for an application to be built, deployed and managed in *OpenShift*. 

The Software templates are stored on our instance of GitLab created for this workshop.

* Explore the templates available:
** Access from your web browser our https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_subdomain}/rhdhub/software-templates[GitLab^] instance.
** You are on the Software Templates repository, *rhdhub/software-templates*.
** Click on the *showcase-templates.yaml* file. This file defines the templates shown on the Software Templates web page on Red Hat Developer Hub.
** In this file, you will see all the defined templates per each application type:
    - scaffolder-templates/frontend/template.yaml
    - scaffolder-templates/spring-backend/template.yaml
    - scaffolder-templates/quarkus-backend/template.yaml
    - scaffolder-templates/gateway/template.yaml

* Explore the Application Source code:
** Go back to the *rhdhub/software-templates* folder
** Click on *scaffolder-templates* and then click on the *quarkus-backend* folder to explore the software templates for the quarkus application.

image::devhub/gitlab_st_details.png[]  

1 - The *template file* is the one defining your workflow when creating a component. 

* Review the file. The file is composed of parameters and steps. 
* The parameters define the user interaction when creating a new component, you will be asked to:
- *Provide information about the GitLab location*
- *Provide information about the new component*
- *Provide Build Information*
* The steps will be executed once you click the *Create* button on the UI workflow.

2 - The *skeleton* folder represents the application source code. 

* Within the folder you will find the *catalog-info.yaml* file. This file defines the *links* shown on the component overview once the component is created. Contains a link to the *OpenShift* application, *OpenShift Pipelines* and https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*^] as part of the developer experience to access an integrated IDE for source code changes.

3 - The application manifests are composed by:

* *argocd* folder with the application definitions to build and deploy the application using GitOps approach with https://docs.openshift.com/gitops/latest/understanding_openshift_gitops/about-redhat-openshift-gitops.html[*Red Hat OpenShift GitOps*^] . 
* *helm/app* folder contains all the manifests to deploy the application using *Helm Charts*. 
* *helm/pipeline* folder contains all the manifests to build the application using https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[*OpenShift Pipelines*^].
