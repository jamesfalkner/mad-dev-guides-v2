== Goals of this lab

As part of Globex's digital transformation and cloud adoption initiative, the development and devops teams embarked upon a journey to modernize their existing siloed services running on virtual machines on Red Hat Virtualization and containerized applications on Red Hat OpenShift separately.

The goal of this lab is to assess and anlyze the current application portfolio and identify potential issues and risks to implementing advanced cloud-native architectures with application modernization.
