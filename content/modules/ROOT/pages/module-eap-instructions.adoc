In this module you’ll work with an existing Java EE application designed for a retail webshop.  The current version of the webshop is a Java EE application built for Oracle Weblogic Application Server. As part of a modernization strategy you've decided to move this application to JBoss EAP, containerize it, and run it on a Kubernetes platform with OpenShift.

== 1. What is Migration Toolkit for Applications?

image::eap/mta_icon.png[MTA Logo, 300]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of Java applications. It's built on the community open source project https://windup.github.io/[Windup^].

It is used by organizations for:

* Planning and work estimation
* Identifying migration issues and providing solutions
* Detailed reporting
* Built-in rules and migration paths
* Rule extensibility and customization
* Ability to analyze source code or application archives

Read more about it in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[MTA documentation^]

=== 1.1. Analyze app using MTA(Windup) IDE Plugin

In this step we will analyze a monolithic application built for use with Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS). This application is a Java
EE application using a number of different technologies, including standard Java EE APIs as well as proprietary Weblogic APIs and
best practices.

For this lab, we will use the MTA https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/6.1/html-single/visual_studio_code_extension_guide/index[Visual Studio Code Extension^] based on Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

The IDE Plugin for the Migration Toolkit for Applications provides assistance directly in Eclipse and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces for developers making changes for a migration or modernization effort. It analyzes your projects using MTA, marks migration issues in the source code, provides guidance to fix the issues, and offers automatic code replacement when possible.

=== 1.2. Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^]. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {devspaces_dashboard}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

image::eap/login_with_openshift.png[login,800]

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_name}
----

* *Password*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user_password}
----

image::eap/che-login.png[login,800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::eap/auth-access.png[auth-access, 800]
====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, delete the workspace first.

image::eap/ds-delete.png[ds, 800]

* *Git Repo URL*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/rh-mad-workshop/coolstore-monolith-legacy.git
----

image::eap/ds-landing.png[ds, 800]

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace quarkus-workshop*. It takes about *60* seconds to finish the process.

image::eap/starting-workspace.png[ds, 800]

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

image::eap/ds-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see existing workspace, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors`.

image::eap/ds-trust-popup.png[ds, 800]
====

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

=== 1.3. Use the configuration editor to setup the analysis

Click on `Windup` icon on the left. Then, a new configuration will be shown up:

image::eap/mta_newconf.png[MTA Landing Page, 700]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this popup, select `Download` button to download the windup command line tool into your VS Code server.

image::eap/ds-windup-cli.png[ds, 800]
====

To input source files and directories, click on `Add` then select `Open File Explorer`:

Note that you might need to remove an existing input directory.

image::eap/mta-add-input.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Open `projects > coolstore-monolith-legacy` then select `monolith` directory. Click on `Choose`:

image::eap/mta-add-opendir.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Then you will see that */projects/coolstore-monolith-legacy/monolith/* directory is added in _--input_ configuration.

Be sure that `eap7` is already selected in _--target_ server to migrate:

image::eap/mta-target.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Click on `--source` to migrate from then select `weblogic`. Leave the other configurations:

image::eap/mta-source.png[MTA Add App, 700]

=== 1.4. Run an analysis report

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the WebLogic application. Note that if you don't see the _Run_ icon, you need to click on the _configuration_:

image::eap/mta-run-report.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI will be executed automatically in a new terminal then it will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::eap/mta-analysis-complete.png[MTA Add App, 900]

=== 1.5. Review the report

image::eap/mta_result_landing_page.png[MTA Langing Page, 900]

The main landing page of the report lists the applications that were processed. Each row contains a high-level overview of the story points, number of incidents, and technologies encountered in that application.

**Click on the `monolith` link** to access details for the project:

image::eap/mta_project_overview.png[MTA Project Overview, 900]

=== 1.6. Understanding the report

The Dashboard gives an overview of the entire application migration effort. It summarizes:

* The incidents and story points by category
* The incidents and story points by level of effort of the suggested changes
* The incidents by package

[NOTE]
====
Story points are an abstract metric commonly used in Agile software development to estimate the relative level of effort needed to implement a feature or change. Migration Toolkit for Application uses story points to express the level of effort needed to migrate particular application constructs, and the application as a whole. The level of effort will vary greatly depending on the size and complexity of the application(s) to migrate.
====

You can use this report to estimate how easy/hard each app is, and make decisions about which apps to migrate, which to refactor, and which to leave alone. In this case we will do a straight migration to JBoss EAP.

On to the next step to change the code!

== 2. Migrate to JBoss EAP 7

As we saw in the report, the application uses a number of Weblogic-specific interfaces and APIs. These are not supported in JBoss EAP 7, so we will need to replace them with standard Jakarta EE interfaces and APIs.

=== 2.1. Jump to Code

Let’s jump to code containing identified migration issues. Expand the *monolith* source project in the Windup explorer and navigate to `monolith > src > main > java > com > redhat > coolstore > utils > StartupListener.java`. Be sure to click the arrow next to the actual class name `StartupListener.java` to expand and show the Hints:

[TIP]
====
You can use `CTRL+p` (or `CMD+p` on Mac) to quickly open a file. Simply start typing the name of the file in the text box that appears and select your file from the list that is produced.
====

image::eap/mta_project_issues.png[mta, 500]

In the Explorer, MTA issues use an icon to indicate their severity level and status. The following table describes the meaning of the various icons:

image::eap/mta-issues-table.png[mta, 700]

=== 2.2. View Details about the Migration Issues

Let's take a look at the details about the migration issue. Right-click on `WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListenerEvent[rule-id:xxx]` in _Hints_ of _StartupListener.java_ file. Click on `View Details`:

image::eap/mta-issue-detail.png[rhamt_project_issues, 900]

The WebLogic `ApplicationLifecycleListener` abstract class is used to perform functions or schedule jobs in Oracle WebLogic, like server start and stop. In this case we have code in the `postStart` and `preStop` methods which are executed after Weblogic starts up and before it shuts down, respectively.

In Jakarta EE, there is no equivalent to intercept these events, but you can get equivalent functionality using a _Singleton EJB_ with standard annotations, as suggested in the issue in the MTA report.

We will use the `@Startup` annotation to tell the container to initialize the singleton session bean at application start. We
will similarly use the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations to specify the methods to invoke at the start and end of
the application lifecyle achieving the same result but without using proprietary interfaces.

Using this method makes the code much more portable.

[INFO]
====
In this section we're going to deal with the following two issues from the report:

image::eap/report_applifecycle_issues.png[Lifecycle Issues]
====

To begin we are fixing the issues under the Monolith application. Click on `WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListenerEvent[rule-id:xxx]` in _Hints_ of _StartupListener.java_ file:

image::eap/mta-issue-open-code.png[mta_project_issues, 900]

You can also navigate to the `coolstore-monolith-legacy` folder in the project tree, then open the file `monolith/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/StartupListener.java` by clicking on it.

Replace the file content with:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import javax.ejb.Startup;
import javax.inject.Singleton;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@Singleton
@Startup
public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @PostConstruct
    public void postStart() {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void preStop() {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
----

[NOTE]
====
Where is the Save button? VS Code will autosave your changes, that is why you can’t find a SAVE button - no more losing code because you forgot to save. You can undo with `CTRL-Z` (or `CMD-Z` on a Mac) or by using the `Edit -> Undo` menu option.

In case you see the red lines in the source code, you can't ignore it because they are the migration issues rather than compliation errors.
====

=== 2.3. View the diffs

You can review the changes you've made. On the left, click on the _Version Control_ icon, which shows a list of the changed files. Double-click on `StartupListener.java` to view the differences you've made:

image::eap/ds-diffs.png[diffs, 800]

VS Code keeps track (using Git) of the changes you make, and you can use version control to check in, update, and compare files as you change them.

For now, go back to the _Explorer_ tree and lets fix the remaining issues.

=== 2.4. Remove the Weblogic EJB Descriptors

[INFO]
====
In this and the following few sections we'll be addressing this part of the report

image::eap/report_mdb_issues.png[MDB Issues, 1100]

Much of Weblogic’s interfaces for EJB components like MDBs reside in Weblogic descriptor XML files. Use `CTRL+p` (or `CMD+p` on a Mac) to Quickly Open `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` to see one of these descriptors. There are many different configuration possibilities for EJBs and MDBs in this file, but luckily our application only uses one of them, namely it configures `<trans-timeout-seconds>` to 30, which means that if a given transaction within an MDB operation takes too long to complete
(over 30 seconds), then the transaction is rolled back and exceptions are thrown. This interface is Weblogic-specific so we’ll need to find an equivalent in JBoss.
====

Remove the unneeded `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file from the **Project Explorer** (not the **Windup Explorer**). This file is proprietary to Weblogic and not recognized or processed by JBoss EAP. Delete the file by right-clicking on the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file from the **Project Explorer** and choosing **Delete**, and click **OK**.

[TIP]
====
If you have the tab for the `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file open (or handy) you can quickly find it in the Project Explorer by right-clicking on the tab and then selecting **Reveal in Explorer** as shown.  You can also use the `ALT+R` (or `Option+R` on Mac).

image:reveal_in_explorer.png[reveal-in-explorer, 600]
====

image::eap/ds-delete-jar.png[ds-convert, 500]

While we’re at it, let’s remove the stub weblogic implementation classes added as part of the scenario.

Whilst still in the Project Explorer, right-click on the `src/main/java/weblogic` folder and select *Delete* to delete the folder:

image::eap/ds-delete-weblogic.png[ds-convert, 500]

=== 2.5. Fix the pom.xml

Lastly, remove Maven dependency on *org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi:jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec*. In JBoss EAP 7.3(or later), artifact with groupId _org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi_ and artifactId _jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec_ are unsupported dependencies. Remove the following dependency in `monolith/pom.xml`:

image::eap/mta-remove-dependency.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

=== 2.6. Re-run the analysis report

In this step we will re-run the analysis report to verify our migration was successful.

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the WebLogic application:

image::eap/mta-rerun-report.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI will be executed automatically in a new terminal then it will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::eap/mta-analysis-rerun-complete.png[MTA Add App, 700]

=== 2.7. View the results

Click on the latest result to go to the report web page and verify that it now reports 0 Story Points:

You have successfully migrated this app to `JBoss EAP 7`, congratulations!

image::eap/mta_project_issues_story.png[mta_project_issues_story, 700]

== 3. Upgrade to JBoss EAP 8

*Upgrading to Jakarta EE 10* is a key aspect of moving to *JBoss EAP 8*. This involves a namespace shift from `javax` to `jakarta`, reflecting the transfer of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation and the creation of Jakarta EE.

=== 3.1. Run the new analysis report

Go back to the `Windup Explorer` icon on the left. Then, update the existing configuration to *unselect* `eap7` and *select* `eap8` in _--target_ server to upgrade:

image::eap/mta-target.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the EAP 8 upgrade:

image::eap/mta-rerun-report.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

It will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::eap/mta-analysis-rerun-complete.png[MTA Add App, 700]

=== 3.2. Fix the javax package issues

Navigate to the *Issues* tab in the analysis report, then click on `javax.persistence has been replaced by jakarta.persistence`. 

image::eap/report_javax_issues.png[Javax Issues]

Lots of existing Java code uses the `javax.persistence` package, which has been replaced by `jakarta.persistence` in Jakarta EE 10. This is a significant change, and you will need to update your code to use the new package.

The Windup (MTA) extension provides a way to automatically fix these issues. Click on `Apply All Fixes` when you _mouse right click_ on the *coolstore-monolith-legathy* folder in the Windup explorer.

image::eap/apply_for_all_issues.png[Apply All Fixes]

It takes 10 - 20 seconds to finish the quick fixes. You can navigate to the `OrderItem.java` file in the *src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model* folder in the project tree, then you will see the `jakarta.persistence.x` package is imported instead of `javax.persistence.x`.

image::eap/fixed_order_item.png[fixed_order_item]

Let's continue to fix the remaining issues.

=== 3.3. Fix the Replace the Java EE XSD with the Jakarta equivalent issues

Search `Replace the Java EE XSD with the Jakarta equivalent` in the _Issues_ tab. 

Replace persistence_2_1.xsd with persistence_3_0.xsd and update the version attribute to "3.0"

Replace beans_1_1.xsd with beans_3_0.xsd and update the version attribute to "3.0"


=== 3.4. Update the pom.xml

== 3.5. Re-run the analysis report

In this step we will re-run the analysis report to verify our migration was successful.

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the WebLogic application:

image::eap/mta-rerun-report.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI will be executed automatically in a new terminal then it will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::eap/mta-analysis-rerun-complete.png[MTA Add App, 700]

=== 3.6. View the results

Click on the latest result to go to the report web page and verify that it now reports 0 Story Points:

You have successfully migrated this app to `JBoss EAP 7`, congratulations!

image::eap/mta_project_issues_story.png[mta_project_issues_story, 700]

[NOTE]
====
You should be aware that this type of migration is more involved than the previous steps, and in real world applications it will rarely be as simple as changing one line at a time for a migration. Consult the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[MTA documentation^] for more
detail on Red Hat’s Application Migration strategies or contact your local Red Hat representative to learn more about how Red Hat
can help you on your migration path.
====

=== 3.7. Build the application

Open a Terminal window. 

image::eap/new-terminal.png[new-terminal, 500]

In the terminal, issue the following command to build the application. This will clean the project and then package it into a WAR file. This is the same command you would use to build the application in a local development environment.:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

image::eap/new-terminal-cmd.png[new-terminal-cmd, 700]

If it builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`), let’s move on to the next issue! If it does not compile, verify you made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

=== 3.8. Containerize the application with JBoss EAP 8

We will now build a container image for the application using the `Dockerfile` provided in the project. This Dockerfile is based on the `Wildfly 28` image (JBoss EAP 8 built on Wildfly 28) and copies the WAR file into the deployments directory of the JBoss EAP server.

*Congratulations!* You have successfully migrated the application to JBoss EAP 8 and containerized it.

== Summary

In this module, you have learned how to use the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) to analyze a Java EE application and identify migration issues. You have also learned how to migrate a Java EE application from Oracle Weblogic to JBoss EAP 7 and then to JBoss EAP 8. You have containerized the application and run it locally using Podman.
