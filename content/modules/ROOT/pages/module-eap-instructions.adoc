In this module you’ll work with an existing Java EE application designed for a retail webshop.  The current
version of the webshop is a Java EE application built for Oracle Weblogic Application Server. As part of a modernization
strategy you've decided to move this application to JBoss EAP, containerize it, and run it on a Kubernetes platform with OpenShift.

=== What is Migration Toolkit for Applications?

image::eap/mta_icon.png[MTA Logo, 300]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of Java applications.

It is used by organizations for:

* Planning and work estimation
* Identifying migration issues and providing solutions
* Detailed reporting
* Built-in rules and migration paths
* Rule extensibility and customization
* Ability to analyze source code or application archives

Read more about it in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[MTA documentation^]

== 1.1. Analyze app using MTA IDE Plugin

In this step we will analyze a monolithic application built for use with Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS). This application is a Java
EE application using a number of different technologies, including standard Java EE APIs as well as proprietary Weblogic APIs and
best practices.

For this lab, we will use the MTA https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/6.1/html-single/visual_studio_code_extension_guide/index[Visual Studio Code Extension^] based on Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

The IDE Plugin for the Migration Toolkit for Applications provides assistance directly in Eclipse and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces for developers making changes for a migration or modernization effort. It analyzes your projects using MTA, marks migration issues in the source code, provides guidance to fix the issues, and offers automatic code replacement when possible.

== 1.2. Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^]. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ DS_URL }}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

image::eap/login_with_openshift.png[login,800]

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: `%USERID%`
* *Password*: `{openshift-password}`

image::eap/che-login.png[login,800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::eap/auth-access.png[auth-access, 800]
====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

* *Git Repo URL*: `https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/tree/ocp-4.13`

image::eap/ds-landing.png[ds, 800]

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace quarkus-workshop*. It takes about *60* seconds to finish the process.

image::eap/starting-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this information page, select `Start your workspace` to continue  using your workspace.

image::eap/starting-workspace-info.png[ds, 800]
====

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

image::eap/ds-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this infomation page, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors.

image::eap/ds-trust-popup.png[ds, 800]
====

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

== 1.3. Use the configuration editor to setup the analysis

Click on `MTA Explorer` icon on the left. Then, a new MTA configuration will be shown up:

image::eap/mta_newconf.png[MTA Landing Page, 700]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this popup, select `Download` button to download the windup command line tool into your VS Code server.

image::eap/ds-windup-cli.png[ds, 800]
====

To input source files and directories, click on `Add` then select `Open File Explorer`:

Note that you might need to remove an existing input directory.

image::eap/mta-add-input.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Open `projects > cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs` then select `monolith` directory. Click on `Choose...`:

image::eap/mta-add-opendir.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Then you will see that */projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/monoilth* directory is added in _--input_ configuration.

Be sure that `eap7` is already selected in _--target_ server to migrate:

image::eap/mta-target.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Click on `--source` to migrate from then select `weblogic`. Leave the other configurations:

image::eap/mta-source.png[MTA Add App, 700]

== 1.4. Run an analysis report

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the WebLogic application. Note that if you don't see the _Run_ icon, you need to click on the _mtaConfiguration_:

image::eap/mta-run-report.png[MTA Add App, 700]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI will be executed automatically in a new terminal then it will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::eap/mta-analysis-complete.png[MTA Add App, 900]

== 1.5. Review the report

image::eap/mta_result_landing_page.png[MTA Langing Page, 900]

The main landing page of the report lists the applications that were processed. Each row contains a high-level overview of the
story points, number of incidents, and technologies encountered in that application.

**Click on the `monolith` link** to access details for the project:

image::eap/mta_project_overview.png[MTA Project Overview, 900]

== 1.6. Understanding the report

The Dashboard gives an overview of the entire application migration effort. It summarizes:

* The incidents and story points by category
* The incidents and story points by level of effort of the suggested changes
* The incidents by package

[NOTE]
====
Story points are an abstract metric commonly used in Agile software development to estimate the relative level of effort needed to
implement a feature or change. Migration Toolkit for Application uses story points to express the level of effort needed to
migrate particular application constructs, and the application as a whole. The level of effort will vary greatly depending on the
size and complexity of the application(s) to migrate.
====

You can use this report to estimate how easy/hard each app is, and make decisions about which apps to migrate, which to refactor, and which to leave alone. In this case we will do a straight migration to JBoss EAP.

On to the next step to change the code!

== 2.1. Migrate to JBoss EAP

In this step you will migrate some Weblogic-specific code in the app to use standard (Jakarta EE) interfaces.

Let's jump to code containing identified migration issues. Expand the *monolith* source project in the MTA explorer and navigate to `monolith > src > main > java > com > redhat > coolstore > utils > StartupListener.java`. Be sure to click the arrow next to the actual class name `StartupListener.java` to expand and show the Hints:

TIP: You can use kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on Mac OSX) to quickly open a file.  Simply start typing the name of the file in the text box that appears and select your file from the list that is produced.

image::eap/mta_project_issues.png[mta, 500]

In the Explorer, MTA issues use an icon to indicate their severity level and status. The following table describes the meaning of the various icons:

image::eap/mta-issues-table.png[mta, 700]

== 2.2. View Details about the Migration Issues

Let's take a look at the details about the migration issue. Right-click on `WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListenerEvent[rule-id:xxx]` in _Hints_ of _StartupListener.java_ file. Click on `View Details`:

image::eap/mta-issue-detail.png[rhamt_project_issues, 900]

The WebLogic `ApplicationLifecycleListener` abstract class is used to perform functions or schedule jobs in Oracle WebLogic, like server start and stop. In this case we have code in the `postStart` and `preStop` methods which are executed after Weblogic starts up and before it shuts down, respectively.

In Jakarta EE, there is no equivalent to intercept these events, but you can get equivalent
functionality using a _Singleton EJB_ with standard annotations, as suggested in the issue in the MTA report.

We will use the `@Startup` annotation to tell the container to initialize the singleton session bean at application start. We
will similarly use the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations to specify the methods to invoke at the start and end of
the application lifecyle achieving the same result but without using proprietary interfaces.

Using this method makes the code much more portable.

== 2.3. Fix the ApplicationLifecycleListener issues

[INFO]
====
In this section we're going to deal with the following two issues from the report:

image::eap/report_applifecycle_issues.png[Lifecycle Issues]
====

To begin we are fixing the issues under the Monolith application. Click on `WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListenerEvent[rule-id:xxx]` in _Hints_ of _StartupListener.java_ file:

image::eap/mta-issue-open-code.png[mta_project_issues, 900]

You can also navigate to the `cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs` folder in the project tree, then open the file `monolith/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/StartupListener.java` by clicking on it.

Replace the file content with:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import javax.ejb.Startup;
import javax.inject.Singleton;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@Singleton
@Startup
public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @PostConstruct
    public void postStart() {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void preStop() {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
----

[NOTE]
====
Where is the Save button? VS Code will autosave your changes, that is why you can’t find a SAVE button - no more losing code because you forgot to save. You can undo with kbd:[CTRL-Z] (or kbd:[CMD-Z] on a Mac) or by using the `Edit -> Undo` menu option.

In case you see the red lines in the source code, you can't ignore it because they are the migration issues rather than compliation errors.
====

== 2.4. Test the build

Open a Terminal window. 

image::eap/new-terminal.png[new-terminal, 700]

In the terminal, issue the following command to test the build:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

If it builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`), let’s move on to the next issue! If it does not compile, verify you made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

[.console-output]
[source,sh]
----

----

== 2.5. View the diffs

You can review the changes you've made. On the left, click on the _Version Control_ icon, which shows a list of the changed files. Double-click on `StartupListener.java` to view the differences you've made:

image::eap/ds-diffs.png[diffs, 800]

VS Code keeps track (using Git) of the changes you make, and you can use version control to check in, update, and compare files as you change them.

For now, go back to the _Explorer_ tree and lets fix the remaining issues.

== 2.6. Fix the logger issues

[INFO]
====
In this section we'll be looking to remediate this part of the migration report:

image::eap/report_logging_issues.png[Logging Issues]
====

Some of our application makes use of Weblogic-specific logging methods like the `NonCatalogLogger`, which offer features related to logging of
internationalized content, and client-server logging.

The WebLogic `NonCatalogLogger` is not supported on JBoss EAP (or any other Java EE platform), and should be migrated to a
supported logging framework, such as the JDK Logger or JBoss Logging.

We will use the standard Java Logging framework, a much more portable framework. The framework also
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html#a1.17[supports
internationalization^] if needed.

In the same `monolith` directory, open the `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/OrderServiceMDB.java` file and replace its contents with:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty;
import javax.ejb.MessageDriven;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.jms.JMSException;
import javax.jms.Message;
import javax.jms.MessageListener;
import javax.jms.TextMessage;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

@MessageDriven(name = "OrderServiceMDB", activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "topic/orders"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "javax.jms.Topic"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "acknowledgeMode", propertyValue = "Auto-acknowledge")})
public class OrderServiceMDB implements MessageListener {

    @Inject
    OrderService orderService;

    @Inject
    CatalogService catalogService;

    private Logger log = Logger.getLogger(OrderServiceMDB.class.getName());

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message rcvMessage) {
        TextMessage msg = null;
        try {
                if (rcvMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
                        msg = (TextMessage) rcvMessage;
                        String orderStr = msg.getBody(String.class);
                        log.info("Received order: " + orderStr);
                        Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);
                        log.info("Order object is " + order);
                        orderService.save(order);
                        order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {
                            catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());
                        });
                }
        } catch (JMSException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

}
----

That one was pretty easy.

== 2.7. Test the build

Build and package the app again just as before:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

If builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`), then let’s move on to the next issue! If it does not compile, verify you made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

== 2.8. Remove the Weblogic EJB Descriptors

[INFO]
====
In this and the following few sections we'll be addressing this part of the report

image::eap/report_mdb_issues.png[MDB Issues, 1100]

To highlight in a little more detail:

* `Call of JNDI lookup` - Our apps use a weblogic-specific
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface[JNDI^] lookup scheme.
* `Proprietary InitialContext initialization` - Weblogic has a very different lookup mechanism for InitialContext objects
* `WebLogic InitialContextFactory` - This is related to the above, essentially a Weblogic proprietary mechanism
* `WebLogic T3 JNDI binding` - The way EJBs communicate in Weblogic is over T2, a proprietary implementation of Weblogic.

====

All of the above interfaces have equivalents in JBoss, however they are greatly simplified and overkill for our application which uses JBoss EAP’s internal message queue implementation provided by https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis^].

[NOTE]
.A word about JMS
====
In this final step we will again migrate some Weblogic-specific code in the app to use standard Java EE interfaces, and one JBoss-specific interface.

Our application uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service[JMS^] to
communicate. Each time an order is placed in the application, a JMS message is sent to a JMS Topic, which is then consumed by
listeners (subscribers) to that topic to process the order using
https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gipko.html[Message-driven beans^], a form of
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) that allow Java EE applications to process messages asynchronously.

In this case, `InventoryNotificationMDB` is subscribed to and listening for messages from `ShoppingCartService`. When an order
comes through the `ShoppingCartService`, a message is placed on the JMS Topic. At that point, the `InventoryNotificationMDB`
receives a message and if the inventory service is below a pre-defined threshold, sends a message to the log indicating that the
supplier of the product needs to be notified.

Unfortunately this MDB was written a while ago and makes use of weblogic-proprietary interfaces to configure and operate the MDB.
MTA has flagged this and reported it using a number of issues.

JBoss EAP provides an even more efficient and declarative way to configure and manage the lifecycle of MDBs. In this case, we can
use annotations to provide the necessary initialization and configuration logic and settings. We will use the `@MessageDriven`
and `@ActivationConfigProperty` annotations, along with the `MessageListener` interfaces to provide the same functionality as
from Weblogic.

Much of Weblogic’s interfaces for EJB components like MDBs reside in Weblogic descriptor XML files. Use kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on a Mac) to Quickly Open
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` to see one of these descriptors. There are many different configuration
possibilities for EJBs and MDBs in this file, but luckily our application only uses one of them, namely it configures
`<trans-timeout-seconds>` to 30, which means that if a given transaction within an MDB operation takes too long to complete
(over 30 seconds), then the transaction is rolled back and exceptions are thrown. This interface is Weblogic-specific so we’ll
need to find an equivalent in JBoss.
====

The first step is to remove the unneeded `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file from the **Project Explorer** (not the **Migration Assistant**). This file is proprietary to Weblogic and not recognized or processed by JBoss EAP. Delete the file by right-clicking on the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file from the **Project Explorer** and choosing **Delete**, and click **OK**.

[TIP]
====
If you have the tab for the `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file open (or handy) you can quickly find it in the Project Explorer by right-clicking on the tab and then selecting **Reveal in Explorer** as shown.  You can also use the kbd:[ALT+R] (or kbd:[Option+R] on Mac).

image:reveal_in_explorer.png[reveal-in-explorer, 600]
====

image::eap/ds-delete-jar.png[ds-convert, 500]

While we’re at it, let’s remove the stub weblogic implementation classes added as part of the scenario.

Whilst still in the Project Explorer, right-click on the `src/main/java/weblogic` folder and select *Delete* to delete the folder:

image::eap/ds-delete-weblogic.png[ds-convert, 500]

== 2.9. Fix the code

Use kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on a Mac) to Quickly Open the `monolith/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/InventoryNotificationMDB.java` file and replace its contents with:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty;
import javax.ejb.MessageDriven;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.jms.JMSException;
import javax.jms.Message;
import javax.jms.MessageListener;
import javax.jms.TextMessage;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@MessageDriven(name = "InventoryNotificationMDB", activationConfig = {
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "topic/orders"),
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "javax.jms.Topic"),
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "transactionTimeout", propertyValue = "30"), #<.>
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "acknowledgeMode", propertyValue = "Auto-acknowledge")})
public class InventoryNotificationMDB implements MessageListener {

    private static final int LOW_THRESHOLD = 50;

    @Inject
    private CatalogService catalogService;

    @Inject
    private Logger log;

    public void onMessage(Message rcvMessage) {
        TextMessage msg;
        {
            try {
                if (rcvMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
                    msg = (TextMessage) rcvMessage;
                    String orderStr = msg.getBody(String.class);
                    Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);
                    order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {
                        int old_quantity = catalogService.getCatalogItemById(orderItem.getProductId()).getInventory().getQuantity();
                        int new_quantity = old_quantity - orderItem.getQuantity();
                        if (new_quantity < LOW_THRESHOLD) {
                            log.warning("Inventory for item " + orderItem.getProductId() + " is below threshold (" + LOW_THRESHOLD + "), contact supplier!");
                        }
                    });
                }


            } catch (JMSException jmse) {
                System.err.println("An exception occurred: " + jmse.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<.> Remember the `<trans-timeout-seconds>` setting from the `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file? This is now set as an
`@ActivationConfigProperty` in the new code. There are pros and cons to using annotations vs. XML descriptors and care should be taken to consider the needs of the application.

Your MDB should now be properly migrated to JBoss EAP.

Lastly, remove Maven dependency on *org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi:jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec*. In JBoss EAP 7.3(or later), artifact with groupId _org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi_ and artifactId _jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec_ are unsupported dependencies. Remove the following dependency in `monolith/pom.xml`:

image::eap/mta-remove-dependency.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

== 2.10. Test the build

Build once again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

If builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`). If it does not compile, verify you
made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

== 2.11. Re-run the MTA report

In this step we will re-run the MTA report to verify our migration was successful.

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the WebLogic application:

image::eap/mta-rerun-report.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI will be executed automatically in a new terminal then it will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::eap/mta-analysis-rerun-complete.png[MTA Add App, 700]

[NOTE]
====
If it is taking too long, feel free to skip the next section and proceed to step *13* and return back to the analysis later to confirm that you
eliminated all the issues.
====

== 2.12. View the results

Click on the latest result to go to the report web page and verify that it now reports 0 Story Points:

You have successfully migrated this app to JBoss EAP, congratulations!

image::eap/mta_project_issues_story.png[mta_project_issues_story, 700]

[NOTE]
====
You should be aware that this type of migration is more involved than the previous steps, and in real world applications it will
rarely be as simple as changing one line at a time for a migration. Consult the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[MTA documentation^] for more
detail on Red Hat’s Application Migration strategies or contact your local Red Hat representative to learn more about how Red Hat
can help you on your migration path.
====

== 2.13. Test the application on JBoss EAP locally

In this development environment (GitPod), a JBoss EAP server is already running with a PostgreSQL database. Click on `Start Wildfly server` terminal in the VS Code, take a look at if the EAP server is running properly:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/eap-running.png" width=700 align=center>
</p>

image::eap/eap-running.png[eap-running, 700]

Copy the packaged application (.war file) to the running EAP server. Run the following command in the `Pre-warm Maven` terminal in GitPod:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cp $GITPOD_REPO_ROOT/target/ROOT.war /workspace/deployments/
----

Go back to the `Start Wildfly server` terminal in GitPod where EAP was started for you, and you'll see `ROOT.war` is deployed:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/eap-deployed.png" width=700 align=center>
</p>

image::eap/eap-deployed.png[eap-deployed, 700]

> **Hint:** If you accidentally closed the terminal that was running Wildfly, you can restart Wildfly with `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0`

You can also find out that the inventory data is created in PostgreSQL. Run the following `psql` command in the GitPod Terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
PGPASSWORD=coolstore123 psql -h localhost -U coolstore monolith -c 'select itemid, quantity from INVENTORY;'
----

The output should look like:

[source,sh]
----
 itemid | quantity
--------+----------
