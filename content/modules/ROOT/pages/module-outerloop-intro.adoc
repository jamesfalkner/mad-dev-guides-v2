The story so far: Globex has been growing quickly thanks to the success of its modernized business applications. However, they have recently experienced several production issues, and after root cause analysis, determined itâ€™s due to unexpected dependencies getting upgraded during builds and admins making out-of-band configuration changes with unexpected consequences. They want to improve how they build, test, and deliver their applications.

In this exercise you will use `OpenShift Pipelines`, a cloud-native continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution built on Kubernetes. It provides a framework for automating the building, testing, and deploying of containerized applications. In addtion, you will learn how you can use OpenShift Pipelines to automate the `GitOps` workflow with Argo CD. By combining *OpenShift Pipelines with GitOps*, developers can achieve a more automated, reliable, and efficient workflow for deploying and managing cloud-native applications.

Let's start the workshop with the discovery of OpenShift and OpenShift Dev Spaces.
