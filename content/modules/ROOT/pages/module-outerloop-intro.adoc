In this workshop you will learn how to promote your application code from Development to Production. 

* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery** (CI/CD) with OpenShift Pipelines
* **GitOps** workflow with Argo CD

In addition, you will learn how to enable **Service Mesh** capability on OpenShift for monitoring your applications 
and how to use it for advanced deployment techniques.
